BGU course intro2CS assignments
This course was the first touch with programming at the university, We learn the basics of Computer Science and classic phrases, problems and algorithms, we implemented them and got many tasks and assignments to do.
My work was with my partner **Khaled Zbidat** (all the assignments with pairs only), he was a genius student.
All the specifications for each assignment have been uploaded via PDF file to the assignment folder.
